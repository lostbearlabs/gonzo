### Overview

This is a utility that encapsulates many of the git activities I perform throughout the day.

Many of these could be accomplished equally well using short shell scripts or just git aliases, 
but some of them require more logic and I find it convenient to have them all implemented in
the same place.

### Usage

To run interactively:
```shell
gonzo
```

To run a single command:
```shell
gonzo [cmd] [arg]
```

To get a list of commands:
```shell
gonzo ?
```


## Build and Install Locally
```shell
./gradlew install
```

### Run 
```shell
./app/build/install/app/bin/app
```
